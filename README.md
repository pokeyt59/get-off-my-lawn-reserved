# Get Off My Lawn ReServed

*Get Off My Lawn ReServed* is a take on the popular concept of player claims for Survival/Freebuild Fabric servers. 
This mod works fully server side (no client mod required!) while being compatible with major Fabric modpacks

This project is a fork [Get Off My Lawn by Draylar](https://github.com/Draylar/get-off-my-lawn), with focus on improving and building on top of the original.

# Getting started

To get started, you'll have to craft a *Claim Anchor*. Each anchor has a different (configurable by admin) claim radius; after placing one, a box around it will be formed. This box is yours!

* **Makeshift**, default radius of 10
* **Reinforced**, default radius of 25
* **Glistening**, default radius of 50
* **Crystal**, default radius of 75
* **Emeradic**, default radius of 125
* **Withered**, default radius of 200

To see claim areas, you'll have to craft a *Goggles of (Claim) Revealing*

When this item equipped in the helmet, mainhand or offhand slot, claim outlines become visible.

## [Recipes](recipes.md)

## Claim configuration:
To configure your claim, you can interact with the anchor block. A UI will appear that offers several configuration options:
- The player list can be used to add and remove access of players to your claim
- The Augment list, that can be used for checking and configuring active augments

## Claim upgrades:
To upgrade your claim, place an Anchor Augment next to the core Claim Anchor. Anchor Augments available include:
- Ender Binding: Prevents Endermen from teleporting
- Villager Core: Prevents Zombies from damaging Villagers
- Greeter: MOTD to visitors
- Angelic Aura: Regen to all players inside region
- Withering Seal: Prevents wither status effect
- Force Field: non-whitelisted players get launched out of the claim
- Heaven's Wings: flight
- Lake Spirit's Grace: water breathing, water sight, and better breathing
- Chaos Zone: Strength to all players inside region
- PvP Arena: Allows changing pvp state in claim
- Explosion Controller: Allows toggling explosion protection

## Config:
You can find config file in `./config/getoffmylawn.json`. To reload it, just type `/goml admin reload` in chat/console.
